  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!

This site is my personal blog and I will put something that I think is good for me.
And if you feel the same, feel free to take. However, if you want to put it for
commercial uses, please let me know first.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
