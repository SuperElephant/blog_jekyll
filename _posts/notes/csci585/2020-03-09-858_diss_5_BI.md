BI

What's the 'big idea'?
- there is already so much data, take use of them


fractal curves (eg. Koch)?
- every node of the structure can have a same structure 

ROLLUP vs CUBE?
- Generally CUBE and ROLLUP are used for reporting purposes and they do the Subtotal and Grand total. CUBE generates a result set that shows aggregates for all combinations of values in the selected columns and ROLLUP generates a result set that shows aggregates for a hierarchy of values in the selected columns.


Your own examples of star, snowflake dims?

Z curve - what other such curves? (can use to index)
- index 2d data to 1d
- hilbert curve, sierpinski curve

QMC?
- (Quasi-Monte Carlo method) use random number to index random number
