### Decision Support Data (warehouse data)

- Effectiveness of BI depends on quality of data gathered at operational level
- Operational data
  - Seldom well-suited for decision support tasks
  - Stored in relational database with highly normalized structures
  - Optimized to support transactions representing daily operations
- Differ from operational data in:
  - Time span
  - Granularity
    - Drill down: Decomposing a data to a lower level
    - Roll up: Aggregating a data into a higher level
  - Dimensionality


![Table 13.5 - Contrasting Operational and Decision Support Data Characteristics](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s018.png)


### Decision Support Database Requirements
- Database schema
  - Must support complex, non-normalized data representations
  - Data must be aggregated and summarized
  - Queries must be able to extract multidimensional time slices
- Data extraction and loading
  - Allow batch and scheduled data extraction
  - Support different data sources and check for inconsistent data or data validation rules
  - Support advanced integration, aggregation, and classification
- Database size should support:
  - **Very large databases (VLDBs)**
  - Advanced storage technologies
  - Multiple-processor technologies

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The data warehouse and operational environments are separated                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2        | The data warehouse data are integrated                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3        | The data warehouse contains historical data over a long time                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4        | The data warehouse data are snapshot data capture ata a given point in time                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5        | The data warehouse data are subject oriented                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6        | The data warehouse data are mainly read-only with periodic batch updates from operational data. No online update are allowed                                                                                                                                  |
| 7        | The data warehouse development life cycle differs from classical systems development. Data warehouse development is data-drivenl; the classical approach is process-driven                                                                                    |
| 8        | The data warehouse contains data with several levels of detail: current detail data, old detail data, lightly summarized data, and highly summarized data.                                                                                                    |
| 9        | The data warehouse environment is characterized by read-only transactions very large data sets. The operational environment s is characterized by numerous updata transactions to a few data entities at a time                                               |
| 10       | The data warehouse environment has a system that traces data source, transformations and storage.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11       | Tje data warehouse's metadata are a critical component of this environment. The metadata identify and define all data elements, The metadata provide the source, transformation, integration, storage, usage, relationship, and history of each data element. |
| 12       | The data warehouse contains a chargeback mechanism for resource usage that enforce optimal use of the data by end users.                                                                                                                                      |


### Star Schema
- Data-modeling technique
- Maps multidimensional decision support data into a relational database
- Creates the near equivalent of multidimensional database schema from existing relational database
- Yields an easily implemented model for multidimensional data analysis 

#### Components of Star Schemas
- **Facts**
  - Numeric values that represent a specific business aspect
- **Dimensions**
  - Qualifying characteristics that provide additional perspectives to a given fact
- Attributes 
  - Used to search, filter, and classify facts
  - Slice and dice: Ability to focus on slices of the data cube for more detailed analysis
- **Attribute hierarchy**
  - The attribute hierarchy provides the capability to perform drill-down and roll-up searches in a data warehouse.

![Figure 13.10 in multidimensional analysis](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/AttrHierarchy2.png)Attribtute hierarchies 

#### Star Schema Representation
- Facts and dimensions represented by physical tables in data warehouse database
- Many-to-one (M:1) relationship between fact table and each dimension table
- Fact and dimension tables
  - Related by foreign keys
  - Subject to primary and foreign key constraints

![example](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s031.png)

- Primary key of a fact table 
  - Is a composite primary key because the fact table is related to many dimension tables
  - Always formed by combining the foreign keys pointing to the related dimension tables
We have the fact table (of transactions) at the center, and denormalized (all-in-one) dimension tables all around.

Here is another representation.

Note: "dimensions are qualifying characteristics that provide additional perspectives to a given fact; dimensions provide descriptive characteristics about the facts through their attributes."

Slicing and dicing the cube provides specific insights..


### Techniques Used to Optimize Data Warehouse Design
- Normalizing dimensional tables
- **Snowflake schema:** Dimension tables can have their own dimension tables
- Maintaining multiple fact tables to represent different aggregation levels
- Denormalizing fact tables

![snowflake schema](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/NormDimTables.png)

<!-- Techniques Used to Optimize Data Warehouse Design
Partitioning and replicating tables
Partitioning: Splits tables into subsets of rows or columns and places them close to customer location
Replication: Makes copy of table and places it in a different location
Periodicity: Provides information about the time span of the data stored in the table -->

### Data Analytics
- Encompasses a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and modeling techniques to extract knowledge from data
  - Subset of BI functionality 
- Classification of tools
  - **Explanatory analytics:** Focuses on discovering and explaining data characteristics and relationships based on existing data
  - **Predictive analytics:** Focuses on predicting future outcomes with a high degree of accuracy

<!-- Data Mining 
Analyzing massive amounts of data to:
Uncover hidden trends, patterns, and relationships
Form computer models to stimulate and explain the findings
Use the models to support business decision making
Run in two modes
Guided
Automated
Figure 13. 15 - Extracting Knowledge from Data

![Figure 13.19 - OLAP Architecture](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s039.png)

![Figure 13.20 - OLAP Server with Local Miniature Data Marts](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s040.png)

#### Relational Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP)
- Provides OLAP functionality using relational databases and familiar relational tools to store and analyze multidimensional data
- Extensions added to traditional RDBMS technology
  - Multidimensional data schema support within the RDBMS
  - Data access language and query performance optimized for multidimensional data
  - Support for very large databases (VLDBs)

#### Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing (MOLAP)
- Extends OLAP functionality to multidimensional database management systems (MDBMSs)
  - **MDBMS**: Uses proprietary techniques store data in matrix-like n-dimensional arrays
  - End users visualize stored data as a 3D **data cube**
    - Grow to n dimensions, becoming hypercubes
    - Held in memory in a **cube cache** to speed access
- **Sparsity**: Measures the density of the data held in the data cube

![Table 13.12 - Relational vs. Multidimensional OLAP](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s043.png)


#### SQL Extensions for OLAP
- The ROLLUP extension
  - Used with GROUP BY clause to generate aggregates by different dimensions
  - Enables subtotal for each column listed except for the last one, which gets a grand total
  - Order of column list important

![ROLLUP extension](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s045.png)
"Subtotal for each vendor - all products; sum of (the only set of) subtotals".


- The CUBE extension
  - Used with GROUP BY clause to generate aggregates by the listed columns
  - Includes the last column

![CUBE extension](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s20_db0ds1ml2agi/lectures/BI/pics/s046.png)

"Subtotal for each month - all products; subtotal for each product - all months; sum of (either set of) subtotals".
<!-- Materialized View
Dynamic table that contains SQL query command to generate rows and stores the actual rows
Created the first time query is run 
Summary rows are stored in the table
Automatically updated when base tables are updated
Requires specified privileges -->
### Data Lakes
A 'traditional' data warehouse is an ETL-based, historical record of transactions - very RDB-like.

A 'modern' alternative is a 'data lake', which offers a more continuous form of analytics, driven by the rise of unstructed data, streaming, cloud storage, etc. In a data lake, data is NOT ETLd, rather, it is stored in its 'raw' ("natural") form [even incomplete, untransformed...].
