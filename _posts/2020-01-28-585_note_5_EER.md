**outline**
- Extended Entity Relationship (EER) model

## Entity Supertypes and Subtypes

- **Entity supertype**: Generic entity type related to one or more entity subtypes
  - Contains common characteristics
- **Entity subtype**: Contains unique characteristics of each entity subtype
- Criteria to determine the usage
  - There must be different, identifiable kinds of the entity in the user’s environment
  - The different kinds of instances should each have one or more attributes that are unique to that kind of instance

## Specialization Hierarchy

- Depicts arrangement of higher-level entity supertypes and lower-level entity subtypes
- Relationships are described in terms of “is-a” relationships
- Subtype exists within the context of a supertype
- Every subtype has **one** supertype to which it is directly related
- Supertype can have many subtypes
- Provides the means to:
  - Support attribute inheritance
  - Define a special supertype attribute known as the subtype discriminator
  - Define disjoint/overlapping constraints and complete/partial constraints

## Inheritance
- Enables an entity subtype to inherit attributes and relationships of the supertype
- All entity subtypes inherit their primary key attribute from their supertype
- At the implementation level, supertype and its subtype(s) maintain a 1:1 relationship
- Entity subtypes inherit all relationships in which supertype entity participates
- Lower-level subtypes inherit all attributes and relationships from its upper-level supertypes
  

## Subtype Discriminator
- Attribute in the supertype entity that determines to which entity subtype the supertype occurrence is related
- Default comparison condition is the equality comparison

## Disjoint and Overlapping Constraints
- **Disjoint subtypes**: Contain a unique subset of the supertype entity set
  - Known as **nonoverlapping subtypes**
  - Implementation is based on the value of the subtype discriminator attribute in the supertype
- **Overlapping subtypes**: Contain nonunique subsets of the supertype entity set
  - Implementation requires the use of one discriminator attribute for each subtype

## Completeness Constraint
- Specifies whether each supertype occurrence must also be a member of at least one subtype
- Types
  - **Partial completeness**: Not every supertype occurrence is a member of a subtype
  - **Total completeness**: Every supertype occurrence must be a member of any
